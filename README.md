Building The Bridge As We Cross It
• Live-streams may end up incomplete
• Andrew may follow up with videos to complete the live stream.
• Emerging technology might be worked in last minute and videos might appear at random eg. DeepSeek.
• Some guest instructors may drop out, and unexpected guest instructors might appear
• Just like a real-world project, scope will change as we go.
• It doesn't matter if we fail
• It matters that we grow domain knowledge and gain technical certainty through our experience.
